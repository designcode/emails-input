# emails-input

A simple plugin to make Gmail style to gather email address. Demo is [available here](https://designcode.github.io/emails-input/demo/index.html)

## Implementation Notes

I've created this library using Typescript and no dependency like jQuery, lodash etc. For bundling, I am using rollupjs.
At the moment, I am only generating bundles for browser.
